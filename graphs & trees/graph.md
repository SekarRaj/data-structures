Vertex/Nodes(V)
Edges(E)

Order of the graph - Number of vertices
Size of the graph - Number of Edges

## Typical graph problems

Typical graph problems are described in the following list.

* finding the shortest path from a specific node to another node
* finding the maximum possible flow through a network where each edges has a pre-defined maximum capacity (maximum-flow minimum-cut problem)
